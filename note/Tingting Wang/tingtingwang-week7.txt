Effective communication and integrity are critical for ensuring the success of team effort.
The communication between our team members is essential for us eliminating waste because of parallel developing this week. Most of the time, our team members communicate through online chatting, ensuring the sharing of new ideas, implementations or problems, and we all try to respond immediately. This is a good way to inform the latest progress without delay. Moreover, this week we had a meeting at the same time at the same place. Everyone talked about the progress and difficulties or problems that were difficult to deal with. We finished the issues and made the plan for the future works. The meeting was short but effective and saved a lot of time. 
Moreover, our team is highly integrated, having the same goal. We shared ideas and technique skills. We all loved to help others to finish our goals. 
The communication and integrity helped us to make effective plans, to deal problems and ensure the fluent process.
