For the first week, our team was well-organized, and the team members were energetic and preferred sharing knowledge. 
All the team members showed high passion about the project at the first week. We had an efficient discussion in the class, including the organization, the meeting time, and the topics. Then, we communicated daily through online Wechat and email. All the messages were responded instantly and modifications were informed immediately. 
The team did the work efficiently. We hold a scheduled and efficient meeting on Thursday. We had a brainstorm about our topic. Each member engaged in the meeting actively, expressed their clear and organized thought, and have a quick thought of othersâ€™ idea. We quickly reached an agreement on the topic, the extra credit activity, and tools for processing, the issues of next meeting. All the decisions and problems to be solved were recorded clearly.
Moreover, all the team members were willing to share knowledge and skills. We learned Waffle.io, Kanban process, basics of Github and sourceTree together. Some members shared their experience and the use of GitHub, sourceTree, DiffMerge, and even showed some demo; some members shared useful books and videos about programming skills, and some members even helped other ones correct syntax error on the individual weekly report. In that way, we saved much time and got well prepared for the next step of the project.
