See the Whole

Thanks to our fixed collaboration style, our team project goes fluently this week. 
Every team member had a clear understanding of individual responsibility, schedule, deadlines and goals of this week. Everyone finished personal work on time with good quality. It is the solid foundation to reach our goal on time. 
Our team solved problems immediately without any doubt. When we encountered obstacles or misunderstandings, we discussed through online chatting group or in communication meeting. This work style saved us a lot of time. 
Respect is an unspoken way of communication, showing support and trust for all the team members. Each team member showed high respect to others in our discussion meeting. We had a discussion meeting at the same study room at the same time this week, talking the main function and details of project structure. Anyone showed on time, present personal ideas clearly, listened to other onesâ€™ opinions seriously and reached an agreement on all the issues without any fight. 
The clear responsibility, problems solve on time, and attach great importance to others' opinions are the key values of our team to finish the project.
