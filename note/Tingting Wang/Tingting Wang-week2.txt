Topic: Communication
 
Compared to the first week, the communication between our team members becomes more fluently. We are more familiar with each other, both on personality and expression tempo. All the members are open minded and straight. So our talk becomes more compact but effective this week.
We had a short meeting for discussing project design and the plan for the next week. All the team members arrived the meeting room at the time we appointed last week. Everyone participated in the discussion with high passion, expressed own investigation and design clearly, cast doubts to others politely, and feedback immediately. Although we had different comprehension on ‘Quick Sort’ and how to implement the game, everyone showed good manner all the time. Then we talked about the work for the next week effectively. Eventually, we reached a consensus on all the issues in just one hour.
