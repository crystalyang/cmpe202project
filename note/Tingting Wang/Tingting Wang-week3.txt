Respect:

For the past two weeks, when we were choosing the topics, having a brainstorm about the design or discussing through online chatting,  all of our team members showed passion for the project and respect to others’ manners, opinions, and even doubts. 
Compared with the first two weeks, everyone showed more politeness and respect on group meeting on September 29th, discussing the schedule of the project. Everyone arrived on time, showing respect to the time of the team. Everyone gave the individual schedule, and listened to others’ carefully, and tried their best to adjust the schedule to adapt to the team schedule. At last, we made a group schedule, taking good care of all members’ schedule. The discussion went smoothly without arguments.
The respectful attitude attributes to smoothness of our discussion and the smooth going of our project. It is a solid foundation to finish the project on time with good quality.
