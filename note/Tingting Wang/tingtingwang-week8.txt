Effective communication and reasonable work distribution are the key values in parallel programming.
This week we faced up some problems about the design, and we had an emergency meeting re-designing the program structure. Team members kept an open mind, engaged in active listening, had active participating the discussion and had a better understanding of the modification. We talked about the structure in detail and fixed all the doubt. We finished our meeting in less than 2 hours. The effective communication eliminates time consuming.
Based on the modification, we figured out all the work need to do, and reload the distribution of work. Much work has been done in quite short time. However, there are still some important issues should be done. And we should spare some time for the extra assignment to get extra point.
Based on the effective communication and work distribution, I think our team can finish the project on time in good quality.
