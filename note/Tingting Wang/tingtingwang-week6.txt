Top: Eliminate Waste
After several weeks of collaboration, our team has formed some good measures to
eliminate waste, especially in time.
This week, we held our meeting at the same time at the same place, talking individual
progress of their function and problems met this week, because we started doing with
some functions. Everyone arrived on time and had a deep thought about their opinion
before arriving. This is a good way to eliminate time wasting, because there is no need
making an appointment or thinking what to talk about. Moreover, we have a detailed
discussion about the logic and pattern of the “Quick-sort” game again, eliminating the
misunderstanding of the game process.
What’s more, we are trying to do tasks in parallel as much as possible. And it is
encouraged to look for help in the group when anyone stuck in a small function or have
technical problems, because the cross on functions will bring in an unforeseeable
problem. So this is a wise way to save time in developing projects.
