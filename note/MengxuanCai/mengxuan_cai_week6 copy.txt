Top: Feedback\
\
Since more and more function and functionalities involved, so the feedbacks of the\
\
functions and functionalities from team members become essentially important.\
\
Recently, although we may not have time to hold meeting everyday, we discussed our\
\
project online everyday. After created a class or a function, we immediately committed\
\
and pushed to github. In this way, our team members could give us feedback as soon\
\
as possible, and we could learn what to do next through these feedback. Feedback\
\
somehow accelerated the development of our game. Besides, JingLu and I also\
\
worked on UI last week, so we need all the opinions of our team members on UI. If we\
\
could get feedback immediately, we couldn\'92t go further out game UI design. Fortunately,\
\
although other team members were very busy, they still offered our projects enough\
\
time including effective UI parts\'92 feedbacks which speed up the process of our project\
\
and help us communicating on our game with each other more efficiently.}
