\f1\fs32 \cf3 Respect is an essential part during our project. What we do when we respect our team members is that we recognise their value. 
\f2\fs24 \

\f1\fs32 During our last meeting, we talk about further implementation. There are still much work to do, UI, \'a0backend and integration. Although we created some conflicts due to different ideas during the meeting, but what we knew first is always respecting others. \'a0With respect, we tried different implementation solution made by all the team members during the meeting and chose a best one for further implementation and development. Respecting team members \'a0and their opinion means that the team member has some value for our team. His/ Her advice and suggestions are important for our project, since our common goal is to make our program better.

\f1\fs32 Respect shows immense strength. It shows that someone is secure enough in their own value to be able to look out into the world to see the value that is out there.
