4 Finished weekly Report submissions(respect). 
Respect:
	During the brainstorm discussion, each team member were energetic about this project. And then we came out the idea which is about quick sort. With respect, everyone agreed with it and thought it was applicable. Since the topic has been  decided, we started to plan the short-term plan(weekly task), long-term plan(whole project) and how to distribute the tasks equally as well. Right after that, we started to learn github together, since most of us havenâ€™t used that before. The one who knows about gitHub taught us with patience and respect, and others respected her tutorial as well. As a good result, we learned how to create a repo, how to pull, how to push ,how to merge and before the actions, how to connect local files and what should we know to avoid unexpected result as well. We also drew a diagram about this flow in case we may want to look back in the future. 
	After the meeting, one of the team members told us that he may not come to team meeting on time if the meeting starts at 3:00pm on every Thursday in the future. After heard about his personal reason respectfully, we decided we could make the meeting later or he could join the meeting on the phone. 
	With respect, the vibe is harmonious, so we can work on our project more efficiently.
