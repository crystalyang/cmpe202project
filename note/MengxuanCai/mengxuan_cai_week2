Respect:
Like the last week, everyone in our team respected each other during the meeting as well as in all the online meeting. Based on our topic, although we held different ideas on how to implement the game,  we didn’t make the discussion into a mess. We discussed the idea one by one - during one’s presentation, he/she had all the attention and was not interrupted by anyone attending the meeting. After that, we analyzed each idea and respected the one who came up with it, and summarized the pros and cons of the view and compared with other views. Then we figured out a optimal way which we all agreed with to do the implementation. And we also discussed about the team weekly submission to make sure that everybody was treated equally, since we didn’t want to anybody feel unrespected.
Everyone in our team appreciated that he/she was respected by others, and liked to give others opinions on the project.  Thus respect guarantees that our project  can develop positively.
