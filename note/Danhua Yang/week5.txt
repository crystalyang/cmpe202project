Topic: Simplicity
	From my observation, our team is always perform very good for the simplicity point. Typically for this midterm week, every team member was busy in preparing for midterms and homework. So we decided to keep every process as simple as possible. We still kept our weekly meeting at the same time on Thursday afternoon and happening the same place in the school library. And we kept our meeting very effective. We discussed everyoneâ€™s work and plans for the next week. We ensured the meeting no more than one hour. And for some unknown issues, we decided to only focus on the most essential parts, and will look back in the future to resolve later. 
	The same as the previous weeks, besides offline meeting, our team discussed very frequently during the rest of the week online. Everyone was encouraged to raise questions. And all our team members thought very well through before asking any questions which also led the entire process flow very efficient.
