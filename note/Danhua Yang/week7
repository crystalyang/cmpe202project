Topic: Communication


	Communication is always an important topic throughout the entire team activity and project. Our team is always performing great in this area. In this week, we were doing as great as previous weeks. We maintained the open atmosphere encouraging every team member to express his/her own ideas. Other team members are all very patiently and carefully listen to whoever is expressing the opinions. 
	Every team member is actively involving in the conversations and discussing ideas or issues with other members. During our regular meeting, every member discussed what he/she did in the past week as well as the planning tasks for the next week. 
	During off-meeting time, every member worked on own tasks. When encountered issues or doubts, we discussed in the online chatting group and always resolve problems in a timely manner.
