Still like previous weeks, our team continued a awesome performance on communication with the team. We’ve organized the team meeting very informatic and efficient. Every team member was welcomed to state his/her opinions and ideas. During this Thursday’s weekly team meeting, we were discussing the UI design and the whole project time frame. The meeting went very smoothly, and we all considered everyone’s class and exam schedule to finalize a plan which could be suitable to everyone.
If say for previous two weeks, out team members were still a little bit shy to each other, this week we were more friendly and more open to the whole team. We have established a good relationship between team mates. Besides the verbal communication, we also did great job on written communication. Outside weekly meeting time, we often discuss the ideas and issues on the online chatting platform. And we’ve managed each meeting content in documents for everyone to review as well as future references.
