For this week, our team maintained the regular weekly meeting on the same time and the same place. Each team member implemented some functionalities of this team project. In this week’s meeting, we discussed the tasks everyone did and went through the entire logics and design of the project. We helped everyone cleared doubts about the further requirements. And we’ve divided the rest of the tasks to every team member. And briefly planned a timeline of every task's’ deadline. 
When we designed each function ticket and divided work, every team member considered about the entire game flow. As well as taking others’ tasks into the plan. We thought about how every components work together. 
Furthermore, at the off-meeting time, every team member works on his/her own tasks. When encounter some issue may be related to others work. Our team always discuss together in the chatting group and solve the issue all together.
