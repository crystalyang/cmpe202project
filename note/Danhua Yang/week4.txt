Topic: Simplicity

	Like the previous three weeks, our team still kept communication and work process as simple as possible. We maintained weekly meeting at the same time and the same meeting room. Every team member was still performing awesome. We all showed up on time and participated in the meeting actively. We kept our timeline clean and focused on the critical part first. For example, we discussed the main project structure and the most important functions of our program. We decided to fill the other things up until the important parts are done. Also, in the meeting, we pointed out the milestones in our project and will follow the timeline to accomplish them. 
	During off meeting time, we discussed in online chatting group. We’ve followed up with each other on each individual tasks and given out feedbacks. For each team member’s individual task. The entire team is focusing on the major part instead of every details. As the result, every one worked on different piece and the entire team was very efficient in the past week.
