This week, the project is approaching its ending stage. Our team has finished the implementation of the basic game logics and functions. The next steps for us is to apply the design patterns to our project, modify the code into restful API and deploy to docker and AWS. In this phase, every task is not what we familiar with any more. Our team has to study and do the research to make it happen.
Per our discussion during the week, every team member is actively studying for the project. And for the unknown area, we all hold the courage to explore. Every team member is very willing to take the responsibilities of this project even it is a brand new area he/she never touched before. 
Because of the unfamiliar, we all encounter some problems that we don’t know the answers or even don’t have any idea how to solve. However, every team member is not shy or try to hide his/her problems. Everyone raises questions and we discuss to solve as a team.
