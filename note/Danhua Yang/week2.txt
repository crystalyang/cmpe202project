Week2: Eliminate Waste

	For the first week, our team members were not familiar to each other and the team structure was not very well organized. As the result, we hosted two team meetings on Saturday and Thursday, spent more than three hours in total introducing ourselves, discussing project topic as well as dividing work to each team member. Nervertheless, because of we were not familiar with waffle.io and github, we had to perform some extra work on practicing them. 
Compare to the first week of our project, I’ve notice that we did a good improvement in eliminating waste in this week. First of all, we’ve decided the weekly catch up meeting time would be on every Thursday in the last week's meeting. So we saved time discussing about the meeting time. Also every team member arranged schedule very well and showed up in the reserved group room on time. No one had to spend any time waiting for any person. Also because we’ve already know each other, the team meeting went very speedy and smoothly. We only spent one hour in finishing discussing all the tasks which set for this week instead of three hours for last week. Last but not the least, every team member practiced with github and waffle in last week. As a very good result, everyone has the ability in using these tools. We didn’t perform any extra work compared to the first week.
