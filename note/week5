Topic: Simplicity
	From my observation, our team is always perform very good for the simplicity point. Typically for this busy midterm season, every team member was busy in preparing for several midterms and homework. So we decided to keep every process as simple as possible. We had our weekly meeting on Monday instead of on Thursday afternoon and happening the same place in the school library for everyone’s convinience. And we kept our meeting very effective. We discussed everyone’s work and plans for the next week. We ensured the meeting no more than one hour. And for some unknown issues, we decided to only focus on the most essential parts, and will look back in the future to resolve later. 
	The same as the previous weeks, besides offline meeting, our team discussed very frequently during the rest of the week online. Everyone was encouraged to raise questions. And all our team members thought very well through before asking any questions which also led the entire process flow very efficient.
