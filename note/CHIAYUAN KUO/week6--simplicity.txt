Topic: Simplicity
 
Simplicity is the state or quality of being simple. Something which is easy to understand or explain seems simple, in contrast to something complicated.  Our team also knows KISS and YAGNI principles very well.  KISS states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complex; therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.  And YAGNI means 「You Aren't Gonna Need It」.  In the former team meeting on 9/15, we determined our project as "quicksort".  In  the last week’s meeting on 9/22, we discussed general ideas of the project and we decided to produce a prototype at the early stage.  In the prior several weeks, we started to build the project.  This week, we decided to implement the project step by step in its flow chart.  It is quite simple way to complete our work without getting confused of connecting all elements to each other.  We made our implementation simple and moved on to the backend algorithm of calculating every item in each step.  In view of the simplicity among our team, I believe our team could work very well toward our project.
