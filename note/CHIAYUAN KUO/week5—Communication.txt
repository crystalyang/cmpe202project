week5â€”Communication

Communication is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules.  In the former team meeting on 9/15, we determined our project as "quicksort"; in the meeting on 9/22, we discussed general ideas of the project and we decided to produce a prototype at the early stage;  in the meeting on 9/29, we started to build the project; last week we discussed main function and data structure of our project.  After the midterm week, we started to catch up with the pace as we planned.   We always keep the project going with good communication, and we did so this week.  Instead of Processing, we discussed to implement the project by Greenfoot due to its eligibility for movement of images.  We built templates for initial setup of items displayed on the screen during our meeting this week.  After that, we realized several essential functions of the project coherently.  In view of the communication among our team, I believe our team could co-work very well toward our project.
