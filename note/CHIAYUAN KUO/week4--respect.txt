Respect is a feeling of admiration or deference toward a group as well as specific actions and conduct representative of that esteem.  In the former team meeting on 9/15, we determined our project as "quicksort"; in the meeting on 9/22, we discussed general ideas of the project and we decided to produce a prototype at the early stage;  in the meeting on 9/29, we started to build the project.  This week we discussed main function and data structure of our project.  We always keep the project going with respect, and we did so this week.  We respect individual schedules for each of our team members.  Some of our team member (including me) had midterm exams this week or next week such that we decided to slow down our progress a bit, and to resume our normal pace after these two weeks.   In view of the respect among our team, I believe our team could co-work very well toward our project.
