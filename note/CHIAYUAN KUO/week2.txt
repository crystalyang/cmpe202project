In the last team meeting on 9/15, we determined our project as "quicksort".  In today's (9/22) weekly meeting, we discussed general ideas of the project and decided to keep it simple, so that we can produce a prototype at the early stage.  We set the number of items to be sorted to about nine in order to prevent from players' being confused by a lengthy array.  We also plan to create additional arrays for each iteration of "quicksort" instead of  in-place "quicksort" because the former is more simple to be easily understood by the players.  Moreover, we made our discussion simple and effective which lasted one hour and we finished all the stuff scheduled in this week.
