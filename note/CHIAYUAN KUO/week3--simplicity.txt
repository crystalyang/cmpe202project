In the former team meeting on 9/15, we determined our project as "quicksort".  In  the last weekâ€™s meeting on 9/22, we discussed general ideas of the project and we decided to produce a prototype at the early stage.  This week, we started to build the project.  Although I was not so familiar with development tools, such as such as Github, SourceTree, and Diffmerge, I am getting used to perform some basic operations, such as commit, push, merge, and pull of those tools, so that during the development of our project I could align with other team members and make it simple for our team to move on finishing the whole.  Moreover, we made our discussion simple and effective which lasted less than one hour and we completed all the stuff scheduled in this week.
